# Project Title: Quality Assurance Tracking System – Automated Auditing & Compliance Management 

 Industry: Multi-Industry (Customer Support, Sales, Manufacturing, Services) 
 Project Type: B2B Salesforce CRM Implementation 
 Target Users: Quality Assurance Managers, Auditors, Customer Support Supervisors, Sales Managers, Compliance Officers 

# Problem Statement: 
Organizations struggle with maintaining consistent quality checks across business processes. Current QA tracking is manual and fragmented across spreadsheets, emails, and disconnected tools. This leads to: 
- Missed compliance checks and a lack of audit trails. 
- Difficulty in holding teams accountable for recurring quality issues. 
- Limited visibility into performance trends and recurring failures. 
- Delays in corrective actions due to a lack of automated alerts. 

To address these challenges, the organization wants to implement a **Salesforce-based Quality Assurance Tracking System** to: 
- Standardize QA audit and scoring processes. 
- Centralize all QA data with secure access controls. 
- Automate task creation, notifications, and escalations for non-compliance. 
- Provide dashboards for real-time monitoring of QA performance, trends, and corrective actions.


# Use Cases: 
### 1. QA Audit Management 
- QA team creates audit records linked to Opportunities, Cases, or Service Work Orders.
- Custom scoring system (pass/fail or weighted scores) evaluates compliance. 
- Automatic follow-up tasks generated for issues identified during audits. 
- Audit logs stored for compliance and traceability.  

### 2. Centralized QA Records 
• Custom object “QA Audit” stores inspection details, scores, and corrective actions. 
• Role-based access ensures auditors, managers, and compliance officers see only relevant data. 
• Linked records (Cases, Opportunities, or Service Items) provide 360° view of audit history. 

### 3. Automated Corrective Actions 
- When QA failures are detected, tasks/cases are created automatically for the responsible staff. 
- Escalation rules notify supervisors if corrective actions are overdue. 
- Validation rules ensure corrective actions are completed before closing an audit. 

### 4. Notifications & Alerts 
- Custom Notifications alert managers about audit failures or overdue corrective actions. 
- Email alerts notify employees when a new QA task is assigned. 
- Slack/Teams integration for real-time QA updates. 

### 5. QA Chatbot for Audit Assistance (LWC + Einstein Bot) 
- A Salesforce LWC-based chatbot assists auditors in filling out audit details step by step. 
- Einstein Bot can recommend standard corrective actions based on past patterns. 
- Responses flow directly into the QA record, ensuring consistency in audits. 

### 6. Asynchronous Processing 
- Bulk audit data (e.g., 1,000+ product QA checks) processed with Queueable/Future methods to avoid governor limits. 
- Integration with external compliance/EHS (Environment, Health & Safety) systems handled asynchronously. 
- Automated nightly batch jobs update QA trends and performance metrics. 

### 7. Reporting & Dashboards 
- Dashboards show QA pass/fail rates, audit trends, and top recurring issues. 
- Compliance heatmaps highlight areas with frequent non-conformance. 
- Team/individual performance reports track adherence to quality standards. 
- Drill-down reports for root cause analysis of failures.
